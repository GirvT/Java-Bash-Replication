NAME:
	pushd

SYTNAX:
	pushd DIR

DESCRIPTION:
	Saves the current working directory by putting it into a directory stack so that it can be accessed later (popd command). Sets DIR as the new working directory where DIR might be relative to current directory or a full path.
	The directory stack is consitent with the behaviour of LIFO stack and stack itself is dynamic.

EXAMPLE:
	pushd cs - puts the current working directory in the directory stack and sets cs as the current working directory
