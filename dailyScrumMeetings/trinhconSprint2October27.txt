What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Created class for FileSystem
	- Incorporated the File class into the package, removed inode package

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Build class for Mkdir
    - Build class for cd
    - Build class for Ls
    - Elaborate the FileSystem to accomodate for other filesystem methods

Am I blocked on anything?
    - If we could make appending and outputing to files more modular
