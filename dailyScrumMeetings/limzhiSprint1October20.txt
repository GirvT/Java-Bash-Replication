a) What did I work on in the last three days? 

>	Edited the main driver to have it continuously ask for input until an exit command is given.
>	Had it go to an different portion of the loop based on what command was given. 
>	Made it print out a line instead of performing the command (since the commands aren't implemented yet)
>	Seperated the command into different portions of an ArrayList based on whitespaces


b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?

>	I intend to create more classes after i get a better understanding of how the others are implementing their part
>	Replace the commands with the actual ones once they are done

c) Am I blocked on anything?  

>	I kinda do want to know the name of the object that im gonna create so i can replace the print statements with the actual calling of the command
